# HA_predict
a visualization window for hemagglutinin prediction
## Introduction
After downloading the file, you can directly run 'run_HA_predict.py' to open the prediction visualization window.The prediction sequences are requested in FASTA format. In the prediction results, score â‰¥ 50 indicate that the protein is identified as a hemagglutinin, and score < 50 indicate that the protein is identified as a non-hemagglutinin.
## Running environment
